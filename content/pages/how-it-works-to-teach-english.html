<section>
  <h2>Step 1: Get TEFL Certified</h2>
  <p>Complete an accredited TEFL or TESOL course online. Most courses take two to four weeks and can be done at your own pace. This is the qualification schools in Cambodia look for, especially if you don't have a degree.</p>
  <p>We recommend <a href="https://bridge.edu/tefl?sid=101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bridge TEFL</strong></a> — they offer internationally accredited, fully online courses starting from 120 hours. Their <a href="https://bridge.edu/tefl/240-hour-master-teo-bundle?sid=101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">240-Hour Master Bundle</a> is especially valuable if you don't have a degree, as it gives you a stronger credential to show employers. <a href="/best-tefl-courses-cambodia-2026">Read our full TEFL course comparison →</a></p>

  <h2>Step 2: Prepare Your Documents</h2>
  <p>You'll need a valid passport with at least six months remaining, your TEFL certificate, a CV, and a short cover letter. Some schools also ask for a basic medical check and police clearance.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Apply for Jobs</h2>
  <p>Apply through GlobeScraper for vetted schools, check Facebook groups like Teaching Jobs Cambodia, or walk into language centres in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap with a printed CV. Most teachers land a job within one to two weeks of arriving.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Sort Your Visa</h2>
  <p>Arrive on an E-class business visa, then extend it once you have a signed contract. Your school typically helps with the work permit process. Avoid tourist visas if you plan to stay long term.</p>

  <h2>Step 5: Start Your New Life</h2>
  <p>Find affordable housing, set up a local SIM card, open a bank account if needed, and settle into your new routine. Cambodia's low cost of living means your salary goes further than you'd expect.</p>
