  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
  <p>I lived in Cambodia and worked as an English teacher in Phnom Penh. Before that, I lived in South Korea. I created Globescraper because people kept asking the same questions about visas, TEFL, finding schools, and daily life in Cambodia.</p>
  <p>Most information online is confusing or written by people who have never lived there. I wanted to make something simple, honest, and useful for anyone thinking about moving to Cambodia to teach.</p>

  <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
  <p>Globescraper is a free resource for anyone thinking about teaching or moving to Cambodia. It isn't a recruitment service and it doesn't place people in jobs. Everything here is based on real experience and written to make the process easier for newcomers.</p>
  <p>You'll find guides on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Teaching English without a degree</li>
    <li>TEFL and TESOL options</li>
    <li>Visas, renewals, and long term stays</li>
    <li>Housing, salaries, and cost of living</li>
    <li>What to expect when you arrive</li>
    <li>Travel and lifestyle tips across Cambodia</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My goal is to cut through the confusion and give you clear steps that actually match the reality on the ground.</p>

  <h2>How This Site Stays Free</h2>
  <p>Globescraper is supported through affiliate links. If you buy travel insurance, TEFL courses, or travel gear through the links on this site, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you.</p>
  <p>This allows me to keep the guides free and continue writing new ones. There are no job placement fees or application charges here.</p>
