  <h1>How to Find a Teaching Job in Cambodia in 2026: Step by Step Guide</h1>
  <p>Learn how to get a teaching job in Cambodia in 2026. TEFL tips, job search methods, salary expectations, visas, and first month budget advice.</p>

  <p>Teaching in Cambodia is far more straightforward than most people expect. There's no degree requirement in many schools, the visa process is simple, and demand for English teachers stays consistently high.</p>
  <p>This guide explains the real process of finding a teaching job in Cambodia in 2026, based fully on experience living and working there.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Get Your TEFL or TESOL Certificate</h2>
  <p>Most schools want to see a <a href="https://www.tefl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TEFL or TESOL certificate</a> even if they don't require a degree. It shows you understand the basics of lesson planning and classroom structure.</p>
  <p>A recognised TEFL/TESOL also helps you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get more job offers</li>
    <li>Secure higher starting pay</li>
    <li>Qualify for better schools over time</li>
    <li>Build confidence before teaching your first class</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can complete a TEFL online before arriving, or choose an in-person program once you land in Cambodia. Both routes work well.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Choose Your City</h2>
  <p>The three most common cities for teachers are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phnom Penh</strong> has the highest salaries, most schools, and fastest hiring</li>
    <li><strong>Siem Reap</strong> has a slower pace, is tourist heavy, and has a friendlier lifestyle</li>
    <li><strong>Battambang</strong> is quieter, community focused, with fewer job openings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your choice will affect your cost of living, commuting style, and teaching environment.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Apply the Way Cambodia Actually Works</h2>
  <p>Many new teachers send dozens of online applications and hear nothing back. In Cambodia, schools often prefer meeting candidates in person.</p>
  <p>The most effective methods are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check Facebook groups like Teaching Jobs Cambodia and Expats in Phnom Penh</li>
    <li>Walk into schools with a printed CV</li>
    <li>Talk to other teachers to hear which schools are hiring</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most teachers land a job within one to two weeks of arriving.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Understand Pay and Contracts</h2>
  <p>Typical pay for new teachers ranges from $1,200 to $1,800 USD per month. International schools can offer $2,000+ but usually require experience.</p>
  <p>Before accepting a job, check:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether housing is included</li>
    <li>Contract length and renewal options</li>
    <li>Teaching hours per week (20 to 30 is common)</li>
    <li>Whether the school assists with visa paperwork</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5: Sort Your Visa and Work Permit</h2>
  <p>Arrive on an <a href="https://www.evisa.gov.kh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E-class (EB) business visa</a>. You get this at the airport on arrival. After you secure a job, you extend the visa and obtain a work permit.</p>
  <p>Many schools help with the process, and visa agents are easy to find.</p>

  <h2>Step 6: Plan Your First Month Budget</h2>
  <p>Bring at least $1,200 to $1,500 USD to cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rent and deposits</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Tuk-tuk rides</li>
    <li>SIM card and data</li>
    <li>Basic household items</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some useful items before you arrive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Universal travel adapter</li>
    <li>Anker MagGo power bank</li>
    <li>Reusable water bottle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 7: Stay Protected and Connected</h2>
  <p>Two essentials for most teachers:</p>
  <ul>

  <h2>Step 8: Join the Community Early</h2>
  <p>Do not wait until you land to build your network. Start connecting before you arrive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Join Facebook groups like <strong>Teaching Jobs Cambodia</strong> and <strong>Expats in Phnom Penh</strong> for real-time job leads and housing tips.</li>
    <li>Follow teacher blogs and forums to understand what daily life actually looks like.</li>
    <li>Introduce yourself in community threads. Schools and recruiters lurk in these groups regularly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you arrive, attend a meetup or a social event in your first week. Other teachers are your best source of advice on which schools to avoid and which ones treat people well.</p>

  <h2>Common Mistakes New Teachers Make</h2>
  <p>Knowing what to avoid saves time and money:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accepting the first offer</strong> without comparing at least two or three schools. Pay and conditions vary a lot.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping the TEFL certificate</strong> because a school says it is not required. You will earn less and have fewer options later.</li>
    <li><strong>Overpacking</strong> instead of arriving light and buying what you need locally at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring the visa properly</strong> and assuming tourist status is fine. It is not. Get on the EB visa as soon as you can.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to Expect in Your First Month</h2>
  <p>Your first month will be a mix of excitement and adjustment. Here is a realistic timeline:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Settle into accommodation, get a SIM card and motorbike, explore your neighbourhood.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Apply to schools, do demo lessons, and attend interviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Accept an offer, sign the contract, and start visa paperwork with the school.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Begin teaching, find your rhythm, and start saving.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some teachers land a job in their first three days. Others take two weeks. Either way, Cambodia moves fast once you show up in person.</p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Finding a teaching job in Cambodia in 2026 is achievable for anyone with good English and the willingness to show up in person. Get your TEFL, arrive prepared, and apply the way Cambodia actually works. The opportunities are there.</p>
