  <h1>How to Teach English in Cambodia Without a Degree (2025 Guide)</h1>
  <p>Want to teach English abroad but don't have a degree? Cambodia is one of the best places to start. Learn how to teach English in Cambodia without a degree, get TEFL/TESOL certified, find jobs, and start a new life in 2025.</p>

  <p>"I thought I needed a degree to teach abroad. Turns out, I just needed a passport, a TEFL, and the guts to actually do it."</p>
  <p>That's what I told my mate after I landed my first teaching job in Cambodia. Like most people, I assumed teaching English overseas was only for uni grads with a formal education degree. But Cambodia proved me wrong, big time.</p>
  <p>If you're feeling stuck in the UK (or wherever you are), tired of insane rent and zero freedom, this guide is for you. You don't need a degree. You don't need years of experience. You just need to want something different.</p>
  <p>Here's exactly how to start teaching English in Cambodia without a degree, and why 2025 is the perfect time to go for it.</p>

  <h2>Why Cambodia Is the Best Move Right Now</h2>

  <p>Cambodia is one of the most accessible countries in Asia for first-time English teachers. Unlike places like South Korea or Japan, Cambodia doesn't require a university degree. And that's not a loophole. It's genuinely more relaxed and welcoming.</p>
  <p>A few reasons people love it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can get a job with just a TEFL certificate and a good attitude.</li>
    <li>The cost of living is low (you can live well on £500–£700 a month).</li>
    <li>The people are kind, the lifestyle is chill, and the food's unreal.</li>
    <li>You're a quick bus ride or flight from Thailand, Vietnam, and more.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whether you're looking for a gap year with purpose or a full lifestyle shift, Cambodia is underrated and it's only getting more popular.</p>

  <h2>What You Actually Need to Get Started</h2>

  <p>Alright, here's what you need to start teaching without a degree.</p>

  <h3>1. A TEFL or TESOL Certificate (Non-Negotiable)</h3>
  <p>This is your golden ticket. Without a degree, a TEFL certificate is what schools look for to show you're qualified.</p>
  <p>You can do it 100% online, at your own pace, and some courses even offer lifetime job support.</p>
  <p>A great one to check out is the Australian Government accredited TESOL that I did myself. It has offered me so many more opportunities thanks to the higher tier of training it gives you. Get in touch with me about it for more information. <a href="/about">Click here to get in touch</a>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fully accredited</li>
    <li>Self-paced</li>
    <li>Accepted by schools across Asia</li>
    <li>Budget-friendly and made for beginners</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It usually takes 2–4 weeks to finish. Get it done before you apply and it'll make life way easier.</p>

  <h3>2. A Valid Passport (Preferably From an English-Speaking Country)</h3>
  <p>Schools usually prefer applicants from countries like the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Ireland, or South Africa. But even if you're not from one of those, don't stress. If you speak English fluently, you still have a shot, especially in more flexible schools.</p>

  <h3>3. The Right Mindset</h3>
  <p>You don't need to be an expert teacher. You just need to be open, reliable, and willing to learn. Most schools will help you with lesson plans and give you some training.</p>
  <p>If you're good with people and not afraid to try something new, you'll be just fine.</p>

  <h2>How Much Do English Teachers in Cambodia Get Paid?</h2>
  <img src="https://assets.zyrosite.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,w=768,fit=crop/AVL7BR1MVyTjZll4/pexels-minan1398-1087727-m2W85GXOw4tOxlG9.jpg" alt="Affordable local market in Cambodia for ESL teachers" loading="lazy" />
  <p>Here's the good part. While it's not millionaire money, it does go far locally.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Entry-level teachers: $800–$1,200/month</li>
    <li>Experienced/International schools: $1,500–$2,000/month</li>
    <li>Some jobs include free housing or end-of-contract bonuses</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You'll usually work around 20–30 hours a week, with time to explore, chill, or pick up side gigs like tutoring.</p>

  <h2>Where Do the Jobs Actually Come From?</h2>
  <p>Most jobs are in Phnom Penh (the capital), but you'll also find opportunities in Siem Reap and Sihanoukville.</p>
  <p>3 ways to find a teaching job in Cambodia:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apply through GlobeScraper</strong> – we connect you with schools that are already vetted and know how to work with foreigners.</li>
    <li>Use Facebook groups like Teaching Jobs Cambodia or Expats in Phnom Penh.</li>
    <li>Walk in and drop your CV if you're already in the country. It's more common than you'd think.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Just be careful though. Some schools are disorganized or offer low pay. That's why going through GlobeScraper keeps things simple (and gets you the visa help you'll need).</p>

  <h2>Do You Need a Visa or Work Permit?</h2>
  <p>Short answer: yes, but schools usually help with it.</p>
  <p>You'll enter Cambodia on an E-Visa (business visa), then extend it once you've signed a contract.</p>
  <p>Avoid tourist visas if you're planning to stay more than a month or two. It's not worth the hassle of visa runs, and it can get sketchy fast.</p>

  <h2>What Else Should You Prepare Before Moving?</h2>
  <p>Here's your no-BS checklist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete your TEFL course</li>
    <li>Save at least £1,000–£1,500 to cover your first month (rent, deposits, food)</li>
    <li>Sort out travel insurance like SafetyWing</li>
    <li>Use a VPN like NordVPN to keep your data safe abroad</li>
    <li>Pack light because you can buy most things cheaper when you arrive</li>
    <li>Learn a few Khmer phrases (even just "hello" and "thank you" go a long way)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts: Is It Really That Easy?</h2>

  <p>Look, moving abroad isn't always smooth. But teaching in Cambodia is genuinely one of the easiest, lowest-barrier ways to start a new chapter without drowning in student loans or needing a perfect CV.</p>
  <p>If you're looking for purpose, freedom, or just a chance to reset, this could be the move.</p>
