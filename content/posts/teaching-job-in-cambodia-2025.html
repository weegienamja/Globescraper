  <h1>How to Find a Teaching Job in Cambodia in 2025: Step by Step Guide</h1>
  <p>Learn how to get a teaching job in Cambodia in 2025. TEFL tips, job search methods, salary expectations, visas, and first month budget advice.</p>

  <p>Teaching in Cambodia is far more straightforward than most people expect. There's no degree requirement in many schools, the visa process is simple, and demand for English teachers stays consistently high.</p>
  <p>This guide explains the real process of finding a teaching job in Cambodia in 2025, based fully on experience living and working there.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Get Your TEFL or TESOL Certificate</h2>
  <p>Most schools want to see a TEFL or TESOL certificate even if they don't require a degree. It shows you understand the basics of lesson planning and classroom structure.</p>
  <p>A recognised TEFL/TESOL also helps you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get more job offers</li>
    <li>Secure higher starting pay</li>
    <li>Qualify for better schools over time</li>
    <li>Build confidence before teaching your first class</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can complete a TEFL online before arriving, or choose an in-person program once you land in Cambodia. Both routes work well.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Choose Your City</h2>
  <p>The three most common cities for teachers are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phnom Penh</strong> — highest salaries, most schools, fastest hiring</li>
    <li><strong>Siem Reap</strong> — slower pace, tourist heavy, friendlier lifestyle</li>
    <li><strong>Battambang</strong> — quieter, community focused, fewer job openings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your choice will affect your cost of living, commuting style, and teaching environment.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Apply the Way Cambodia Actually Works</h2>
  <p>Many new teachers send dozens of online applications and hear nothing back. In Cambodia, schools often prefer meeting candidates in person.</p>
  <p>The most effective methods are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check Facebook groups like Teaching Jobs Cambodia and Expats in Phnom Penh</li>
    <li>Walk into schools with a printed CV</li>
    <li>Talk to other teachers to hear which schools are hiring</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most teachers land a job within one to two weeks of arriving.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Understand Pay and Contracts</h2>
  <p>Typical pay for new teachers ranges from $1,200 to $1,800 USD per month. International schools can offer $2,000+ but usually require experience.</p>
  <p>Before accepting a job, check:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether housing is included</li>
    <li>Contract length and renewal options</li>
    <li>Teaching hours per week (20 to 30 is common)</li>
    <li>Whether the school assists with visa paperwork</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5: Sort Your Visa and Work Permit</h2>
  <p>Arrive on an E-class (EB) business visa. You get this at the airport on arrival. After you secure a job, you extend the visa and obtain a work permit.</p>
  <p>Many schools help with the process, and visa agents are easy to find.</p>

  <h2>Step 6: Plan Your First Month Budget</h2>
  <p>Bring at least $1,200 to $1,500 USD to cover:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rent and deposits</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Tuk-tuk rides</li>
    <li>SIM card and data</li>
    <li>Basic household items</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some useful items before you arrive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Universal travel adapter</li>
    <li>Anker MagGo power bank</li>
    <li>Reusable water bottle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 7: Stay Protected and Connected</h2>
  <p>Two essentials for most teachers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NordVPN</strong> for secure browsing</li>
    <li><strong>SafetyWing</strong> travel insurance for health and accidents abroad</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Finding a teaching job in Cambodia in 2025 is achievable for anyone with good English and the willingness to show up in person. Get your TEFL, arrive prepared, and apply the way Cambodia actually works. The opportunities are there.</p>
