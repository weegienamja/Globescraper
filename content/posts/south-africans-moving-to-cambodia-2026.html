  <h1>South Africans in Cambodia: 2026 Guide to Moving, Teaching, and Living Well</h1>
  <p>A complete 2026 guide for South Africans moving to Cambodia. TEFL, visas, jobs, housing, costs, and life on the ground.</p>

  <p>I met more South Africans in Cambodia than anywhere else outside SA. Engineers who switched to teaching, nurses who wanted a reset, new grads, and a couple who ran a coffee cart near the riverside. If you want a place where money goes further and community shows up fast, this is your playbook.</p>

  <h2>Why so many Safas choose Cambodia</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Degree not essential for many teaching roles when you have a solid TEFL</li>
    <li>Lower cost of living than most big SA cities with a calmer daily pace</li>
    <li>Easy travel to Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos for long weekends</li>
    <li>Active expat circles and a big South African presence in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What life can look like in Phnom Penh or Siem Reap</h2>
  <p>Weekdays are simple. Morning classes, a late breakfast, lesson planning in a cafe, then a gym session or a sunset walk along the river. Weekends shift between temple trips, football watch parties, and rides out to the countryside. The social scene is friendly and low stress.</p>

  <h2>The move, step by step</h2>

  <h3>1. Get TEFL or TESOL</h3>
  <p>Aim for <a href="https://bridge.edu/tefl/courses/professional/120-hour-master-certificate?sid=101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">120 hours or more</a>. Online is fine. It proves you can plan lessons, manage a class, and cover grammar basics. I recommend <a href="https://bridge.edu/tefl?sid=101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bridge TEFL</strong></a> — their certificates are internationally recognised and accepted across Asia. Finish the certificate before you send CVs. It speeds up job offers.</p>

  <h3>2. Line up documents</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Valid passport with at least 6 months left</li>
    <li>Digital copies of TEFL certificate and CV</li>
    <li>A simple cover letter tailored to kids, teens, or adults</li>
    <li>Some schools ask for a basic medical check and a police clearance. Get those ready if possible</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Understand visas and work permits</h3>
  <p>The usual route for teachers is the <a href="https://www.evisa.gov.kh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ordinary E class entry</a> then an EB extension once you have a contract and paperwork from your school. You also need a work permit to be fully legal. Many schools and agencies help with both. Start with the right entry option and avoid overstay fines.</p>
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Visa rules shift. Confirm the latest requirements with your employer or a reputable agency before you fly.</p>

  <h3>4. Job hunting that actually works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply through GlobeScraper for vetted schools and help with paperwork</li>
    <li>Arriving in person helps. Walk a CV to language centers in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap</li>
    <li>Be ready to demo a 10 minute lesson. Keep it simple with pair work and a clear target</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. First month budget in ZAR</h3>
  <p>Exchange rates move. These ranges keep a safety buffer.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Item</th><th>Cost Range</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Deposit and first month rent</td><td>R6,000 to R14,000</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Motorbike rental or rides</td><td>R900 to R1,600</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Food and groceries</td><td>R2,500 to R4,200</td></tr>
      <tr><td>SIM and data</td><td>R120 to R250</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Misc setup and lesson supplies</td><td>R800 to R1,500</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>After month one, costs settle. Cooking at home and avoiding imported snacks keeps spending low.</p>

  <h2>Where people live</h2>

  <h3>Phnom Penh</h3>
  <p>Good for salaries, big school network, and weekend league sport. Look at areas near Russian Market, BKK, or Tonle Bassac if you want cafes and short commutes.</p>

  <h3>Siem Reap</h3>
  <p>Slower pace and temple access. Strong community feel and easy cycling routes. Rents are lower than the capital for similar quality.</p>

  <h3>Battambang</h3>
  <p>Smaller city, cheaper rents, and a creative scene. Fewer jobs than Phnom Penh but a great base once you have work.</p>

  <h2>What you can earn</h2>
  <p>Entry roles often sit between 700 and 1,200 USD per month. Experienced teachers and international schools can reach 1,500 to 2,000 USD. Hours are usually 20 to 30 per week. Private tutoring can add extra income.</p>

  <h2>SIM cards, internet, and security</h2>
  <p>Smart, Cellcard, and Metfone cover most of the country. A starter plan is cheap and easy with your passport at any mall kiosk. Speeds vary by district. Cafes and coworking spaces have decent Wi-Fi across the main cities.</p>
  <p>Protect your connection on public Wi-Fi. <a href="https://nordvpn.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_term&utm_content&utm_source=aff&utm_campaign=off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NordVPN</a> keeps logins safe and lets you access South African banking sites without issues.</p>

  </div>

  <h2>Banking and money</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Both USD and riel circulate. Keep small notes for daily rides and markets</li>
    <li>Use ATMs that dispense USD to avoid extra swaps</li>
    <li>Bring a low fee travel card as backup and store bank numbers securely</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Housing playbook</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>View in daylight, check water pressure and aircon</li>
    <li>Ask for a short initial lease, then extend once you settle</li>
    <li>Live a bit outside the center for better value and quieter streets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Packing and power</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Light shirts and breathable trousers for heat and humidity</li>
    <li>Closed shoes for school, sandals for everything else</li>
    <li>Universal adapter that handles type A, C, and G plugs</li>
    <li>Voltage in Cambodia is 230V at 50Hz. Most laptop and phone chargers are already 100 to 240V</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Healthcare and travel cover</h2>
  <p>Private clinics in the capital are fine for routine care. Serious issues often mean a flight to Bangkok. Get proper cover from day one.</p>
  <p>I use <a href="https://safetywing.com/?referenceID=26254350&utm_source=26254350&utm_medium=Ambassador" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SafetyWing Nomad Insurance</a>.

  <h2>Your first week checklist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Get a local SIM and top up a monthly data plan</li>

    <li>Find a gym or a sports club. Community is everything</li>
    <li>Join local Facebook and Telegram groups for jobs, flats, and weekend plans</li>
    <li>Map the nearest clinic and a pharmacy that is open late</li>
  </ul>
