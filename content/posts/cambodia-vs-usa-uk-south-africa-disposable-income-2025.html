  <h1>Cambodia vs USA, UK, and South Africa in 2025: Who Has the Most Disposable Income?</h1>
  <p>Compare real disposable income for young adults in Cambodia, the USA, the UK, and South Africa in 2025. This guide breaks down salaries, commuting costs, rent, and living expenses to show where your money actually goes.</p>

  <h2>1. What Is Disposable Income and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
  <p>Disposable income is the money left after you pay for rent, food, transport, and bills. It is the cash you actually get to spend or save. A high salary means nothing if costs swallow everything.</p>
  <p>For young adults aged 18 to 30, this number decides your quality of life. It decides whether you can save, travel, or just breathe without checking your balance every day.</p>

  <h2>2. The Cost of Getting to Work</h2>
  <p>Transport is one of the biggest hidden costs for young workers. In Cambodia, a motorbike costs $50 to $70 per month to rent. Fuel is cheap. There is no car payment, no insurance premium, and no MOT.</p>
  <p>In the USA, a car payment alone runs $500 per month. Add fuel, insurance, and maintenance and you are looking at $800 to $1,000 before you even start paying rent.</p>
  <p>The UK is not much better. Petrol, insurance, road tax, and train tickets all eat into your paycheck.</p>
  <p>In South Africa, fuel costs are high and public transport is limited in most cities. Many young adults spend R1,500 to R3,000 per month just getting to work.</p>

  <h2>3. Rent: The Biggest Monthly Expense</h2>
  <p>Rent in Cambodia for a private apartment runs $250 to $350 per month. That gets you a clean, furnished place with Wi-Fi and air conditioning. Shared apartments start even lower at $150.</p>
  <p>In the USA, average rent for a one bedroom starts at $1,300. In major cities it goes much higher. The UK is similar, with rents of £900 to £1,200 in most towns and cities.</p>
  <p>South Africa sits somewhere in between. Rent in Johannesburg or Cape Town ranges from R6,000 to R9,000 for a basic flat.</p>

  <h2>4. Food and Daily Living</h2>
  <p>Street food in Cambodia costs $2 to $5 per meal. A full grocery shop at a local market runs $100 to $200 per month. Eating well is cheap and easy.</p>
  <p>In the USA and UK, groceries alone can hit $400 to $600 per month. Eating out adds up fast.</p>
  <p>In South Africa, food prices have risen sharply. Monthly grocery bills sit around R3,000 to R4,500 for a single person.</p>

  <h2>5. Entertainment and Social Life</h2>
  <p>A night out in Cambodia costs $15 to $25. Draft beer is $1. Coffee is $2. Temples and cultural events are free or $1 entry.</p>
  <p>Compare that to $50 to $100 for a night out in the USA or UK. Even a casual evening in South Africa can run R500 to R800.</p>
  <p>The difference is simple: in Cambodia you can enjoy life without worrying about the bill.</p>

  <p>Even with a lower salary, Cambodia gives young adults more usable income each month. The gap comes from cheap rent and cheap transport. Most Western countries lose more than half their income to cars, fuel, rent, and debt. Cambodia does not have these financial drains.</p>
