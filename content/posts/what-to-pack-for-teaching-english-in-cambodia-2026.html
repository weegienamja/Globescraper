  <h1>What to Pack for Teaching English in Cambodia: 2026 Guide for New Teachers</h1>
  <p>Essential packing list for teaching English in Cambodia in 2026. Avoid mistakes, save money, and start your move prepared.</p>

  <p>Packing wrong can ruin your first month in Cambodia. The wrong clothes, missing adapters, or forgetting about the heat will leave you sweating, broke, and unprepared. This guide gives you the fix so you step off the plane like you have done it before.</p>

  <h2>Skip the Winter Coat. Bring Real Essentials.</h2>
  <p>You do not need heavy jeans, jumpers, or thick boots. Cambodia's heat is a full-time deal. Overpacking the wrong gear is not just a mistake, it is extra baggage you will regret.</p>
  <p>What to bring instead:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Loose-fitting clothes</strong> because it is hot, humid, and often dusty</li>
    <li><strong>Breathable shirts</strong> like short sleeves or light button-ups</li>
    <li><strong>One modest outfit</strong> since temples and schools will expect it</li>
    <li><strong>Decent shoes</strong> like walking sandals or breathable trainers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Skip the heavy fashion. No one cares. You are here to live, teach, and explore.</p>

  <h2>Power Problems? Avoid Them.</h2>
  <p>Do not get caught in the heat without a charged phone or the wrong plug. A power mistake ruins your first week.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Universal Travel Adapter</strong> that works in every outlet you will find in Cambodia.</li>
    <li><strong>Anker MagGo 10,000mAh Power Bank</strong> which is perfect for bus rides, school days, and remote towns.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most local shops will not sell high-quality gear. Pack it right the first time.</p>

  <h2>Water's Life. Stay Hydrated or Suffer.</h2>
  <p>Tap water is <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/cambodia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not safe to drink</a>. Bottled water is everywhere, but plastic waste stacks up fast. If you are walking around temples or sweating through classes, you need your own solution.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reusable Water Bottle</strong> to keep you cool and covered in every season.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pack Like You Are Mobile</h2>
  <p>You will not be dragging a suitcase through the streets. You will be hopping into tuk-tuks, climbing steep stairwells, and navigating cracked pavements. You need gear that moves with you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tomtoc 40L Backpack</strong> which is lightweight, spacious, and perfect for border runs. I use it myself and it just works.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Protect Your Internet. Protect Your Accounts.</h2>
  <p>You will be using café Wi-Fi, school networks, and hotel internet. Without a VPN, you are risking your logins and personal data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://nordvpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NordVPN</a></strong> to access UK/US content, protect your accounts, and stay secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Insurance That Actually Covers You</h2>
  <p>Injuries, accidents, and stolen phones all happen. When they do, you need more than a local clinic that only takes cash.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://safetywing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SafetyWing Travel Insurance</a></strong> is built for digital nomads and teachers. It works in Cambodia and covers most real-world issues.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Medications and First Aid</h2>
  <p>Pharmacies in Cambodia stock common pills, but brand names differ and advice can be hit or miss. Bring a small kit with you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ibuprofen and paracetamol</strong> for headaches, fevers, and the general beating the heat gives you.</li>
    <li><strong>Rehydration sachets</strong> because dehydration creeps up fast in 35°C heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Diarrhoea tablets</strong> since your stomach will adjust, but the first two weeks can be rough.</li>
    <li><strong>Antihistamines</strong> for dust, mosquito bites, and random allergic reactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Insect repellent with DEET</strong> because dengue and malaria are real risks in rural provinces.</li>
    <li><strong>Sunscreen SPF 50+</strong> that is hard to find at a decent price locally.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Keep a photo of any prescription medications on your phone in case a doctor needs to verify what you take.</p>

  <h2>Teaching Supplies Worth Packing</h2>
  <p>Most schools provide a whiteboard and markers. Everything else is on you, at least at the start.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A small Bluetooth speaker</strong> for classroom listening activities and games.</li>
    <li><strong>Laminated flashcards</strong> or print a set before you leave. They survive humidity better than paper.</li>
    <li><strong>A lightweight laptop or tablet</strong> for lesson planning, worksheets, and staying organised.</li>
    <li><strong>USB stick</strong> with backup lesson plans. Internet can cut out mid-class.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You do not need to go overboard. After your first week, you will know exactly what your school provides and where the gaps are.</p>

  <h2>Documents You Cannot Forget</h2>
  <p>Losing paperwork abroad is a nightmare. Bring physical and digital copies of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Passport (with at least 6 months validity)</li>
    <li>TEFL or TESOL certificate</li>
    <li>Degree certificate (if you have one)</li>
    <li>Police clearance (some schools ask for this)</li>
    <li>Passport-style photos (four or more, used for visa extensions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Store digital copies in cloud storage and email them to yourself. If your bag is stolen, you still have everything you need to sort replacement documents.</p>
