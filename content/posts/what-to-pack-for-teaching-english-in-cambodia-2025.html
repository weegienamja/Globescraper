  <p>Packing wrong can ruin your first month in Cambodia. The wrong clothes, missing adapters, or forgetting about the heat will leave you sweating, broke, and unprepared. This guide gives you the fix so you step off the plane like you have done it before.</p>

  <h2>Skip the Winter Coat. Bring Real Essentials.</h2>
  <p>You do not need heavy jeans, jumpers, or thick boots. Cambodia's heat is a full-time deal. Overpacking the wrong gear is not just a mistake, it is extra baggage you will regret.</p>
  <p>What to bring instead:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Loose-fitting clothes</strong> — it is hot, humid, and often dusty</li>
    <li><strong>Breathable shirts</strong> — short sleeves or light button-ups work best</li>
    <li><strong>One modest outfit</strong> — temples and schools will expect it</li>
    <li><strong>Decent shoes</strong> — walking sandals or breathable trainers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Skip the heavy fashion. No one cares — you are here to live, teach, and explore.</p>

  <h2>Power Problems? Avoid Them.</h2>
  <p>Do not get caught in the heat without a charged phone or the wrong plug. A power mistake ruins your first week.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Universal Travel Adapter</strong> — works in every outlet you will find in Cambodia.</li>
    <li><strong>Anker MagGo 10,000mAh Power Bank</strong> — perfect for bus rides, school days, and remote towns.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most local shops will not sell high-quality gear. Pack it right the first time.</p>

  <h2>Water's Life. Stay Hydrated or Suffer.</h2>
  <p>Tap water is not safe to drink. Bottled water is everywhere, but plastic waste stacks up fast. If you are walking around temples or sweating through classes, you need your own solution.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reusable Water Bottle</strong> — keeps you cool and covered in every season.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pack Like You Are Mobile</h2>
  <p>You will not be dragging a suitcase through the streets. You will be hopping into tuk-tuks, climbing steep stairwells, and navigating cracked pavements. You need gear that moves with you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tomtoc 40L Backpack</strong> — lightweight, spacious, and perfect for border runs. I use it myself and it just works.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Protect Your Internet. Protect Your Accounts.</h2>
  <p>You will be using café Wi-Fi, school networks, and hotel internet. Without a VPN, you are risking your logins and personal data.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>NordVPN</strong> — access UK/US content, protect your accounts, and stay secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Insurance That Actually Covers You</h2>
  <p>Injuries, accidents, stolen phones — these happen. When they do, you need more than a local clinic that only takes cash.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SafetyWing Travel Insurance</strong> — built for digital nomads and teachers. Works in Cambodia and covers most real-world issues.</li>
  </ul>
